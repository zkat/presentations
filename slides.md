# Your Code Sucks!

## Hooray!

An overview of GBI's code review process, and why everyone benefits when we
read each other's code.

--

* Normalizes application style
* Makes everyone pay more attention to detail
* More knowledge sharing between team (general and project-specific)
* Oleg Protection
* Everyone will make a mistake at some point. **Everyone**

--

* Make it a habit, not an event
* Keep code in branches!
* Always review -- require a +1
* Nitpick on others and ignore it when others do it
* Run the code at least once
* Ask questions, instead of accusing
* Stay on topic
* Review process is developed as a team
